# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 
I want to be able to see the weather across several cities as I travel. The current weather for the day should be shown based on the city searched in the search bar. There should also be a history of your previous searches and a clear history button in order to clear your previous searches. The forecast for the next 5 days should also be shown as well.
